Personal solutions to Tomorrow Corporation's "Human Resource Machine" and "7 billion people" game problems.

Those are solutions I have for each stage so far.
Created for fun (although it helps me remember the struggle it was to come up with all this s**t)

In the solution filename there are two flags:

  [s] - If the code size is optimal*
  
  [t] - If the running time is optimal*

* According to the game developers
